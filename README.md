## ✅ Step 1: Sync the Code
Run these commands in your terminal to apply the connection fix:

1. `git add .`
2. `git commit -m "Zero-Block Signup Fix v1.3.3"`
3. `git push origin main`

## 🛠️ Step 2: Clear the "Offline" Cache
If your login or signup still says "offline" after the rebuild:

1.  Refresh your site.
2.  Look for the tiny **"Still saying offline? Click here"** link at the bottom of the form.
3.  Click it to force a fresh connection.

## 🔒 Step 3: Verify the Key
Ensure the API Key you whitelisted in Google Cloud matches the one shown in your Browser Console (F12):
- **Whitelisted Key**: The one ending in `...4qdA`.
- **Render Variable**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` should be that exact key.
